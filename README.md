# Location Classification

## Using UN/ISO Standards

This talk was presented at the (awesome) <a href='https://www.govcampconnect.org/'>GovCampConnect</a>
all-Ireland unconference. It is a brief introduction to the idea of using
UN <a href='http://www.unece.org/cefact/locode/welcome.html'>LOCODEs</a> as a means of fuzzily linking
city-scale location data.

This provides a fairly small, offline database that has entries clustered around areas of high economic
activity. However, it comes with a few caveats, and the primary formal avenue for improving it is through
regional and national government contacts - so to GovCamp to raise awareness!

Thanks to all there for feedback, for the excellent calibre of discussions and an event full of people
with interesting perspectives finding ways of just getting things done. Congratulations to the GovCampConnect
team - looking forward to returning next year.
